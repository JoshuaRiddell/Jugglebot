This simulation builds on the StewartPlatform Class (in a somewhat clunky way...) to also solve the forces inside the legs at each instant.

THIS SIMULATION IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!

To do list:
 - Check that everything is working as it should (I last stopped working on this somewhat abruptly)
 - Change plot so that legs are coloured based on internal force (will make troubleshooting much easier)
 - Add inertia handling
 - Probably more that I can't think of right now
