# Trajectory Planning

## Overview
There are two scripts in this directory:
1. path_creator.py shows how the bezier paths are made
2. trajectory_planning.py exhibits my initial (somewhat naive) approach to Jugglebot control - following the bezier curves and controlling the velocity/acceleration of the hand along these paths to ensure a smooth incoming and outgoing ball position and velocity. 

Examples of both of these scripts can be found in the third weekly livestream.
