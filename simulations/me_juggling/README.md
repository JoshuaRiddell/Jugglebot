This simulation uses data collected from a VICOM tracking system during my university studies. It is currently set up to animate a humanoid figure to match the same motions that I made while juggling each number of balls.

Some numbers of objects have multiple versions (a, b etc.) and all have eg "_2sec" versions, where the raw data has been cropped to show only the best/most stable/etc. pattern.
